It's 19:12 and I ve just opened this account with prose.io in the last minute. It is a text editor that alllows me to open a file in the remote repo of my dumbblog and make changes. This would make it easy for a client I think.

But i had to chamge the YAML front matter from Published: false to Layout: page
