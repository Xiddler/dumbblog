Spending The Days Of Your Life
<hr />
<p>This is a great way to spend the afternoon. Wednesday 3am. Now I wish that I had included a list of the greates people that had ever lived. This list is not available to me at the present time.</p>

<p>However, I am willing to come up with one myself. Where are the snows of yesterday, aye, where are they? This is a question that does not have an answer. Hence, do not waste your time comptemplating it…</p>
